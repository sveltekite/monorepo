# SvelteKit Sails Todo

- [ ] Add Default Components to generated output (incl. component getters)
- [ ] Separate SvelteKite logic from generated app logic
- [ ] Move `DataSave` import to `withSave` function
- [ ] Figure out how to make withInstance reactive (or just pass the data)
   - can use {#key}
   - can use await in derived expression (now that withSave is inside a boundary)
